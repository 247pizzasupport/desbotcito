# Desbotcito

This is a discord bot that serves the sole purpose of memeing.

# How it works

bot.py is the control script that controls how the bot handles messages and what functionality it has.

# Using it

To stop the running process use 'ps aux | grep bot.py' to find the PID, then use 'kill {PID}' to kill the process.
To run the python process in the background use 'python3 bot.py &'
